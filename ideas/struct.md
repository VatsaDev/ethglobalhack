# App struct

 - `DONE - landing, initial pitch/onboard` 
 - `DONE - login/signup stage, standard firebase auth`
 - home/dashboard, managing your agent, upload new materials, edit the agents understanding of your docs, etc, `ADD the flow chart style controls` 
 - search, discover `All of search works, just add crypto stuff`
 - all the crypto integrations
     - story ai, access your own data just fine, watermarked data on the chain 
     - coinbase, add mpc wallet extractions
     - maybe scale transacts will work, unsure if that adds to coinbase
