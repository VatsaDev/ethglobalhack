# App struct

 - `landing, initial pitch/onboard` 
 - `login/signup stage, standard firebase auth`
 - home/dashboard, managing your agent, upload new materials, edit the agents understanding of your docs, etc 
 - search, discover and rank other agents `UI made`
 - billing page, stripe dashboard style ongoing agent jobs+earnings/mrr/customers graph
 - all the crypto integrations
     - story ai, access your own data just fine, watermarked data on the chain 
     - coinbase, add mpc wallet extractions
     - maybe scale transacts will work, unsure if that adds to coinbase 
     - maybe ens naming and ENS cred features

 got to have DB stuff for each user in firebase
