# Overall final idea

 - Extend, the AI agent platform (thinking of a slinky logo type thing)
 - advertise this as the dream agent platform 

 - Bascially you take the base agent, and extend it with your special skills and information that other people will not have
     - the basic agent is only somewhat good at certain tasks, so you get better results with the specialized versions that has documents and your instilled info involved 

 - Quick example is that a default model might not make as business friendly charts as a business analyist trained model, or that a basic model might not be able to solve complex physics questions, while a physics trained one can, could also use an example of default agent code, vs one with competitive programming docs, and one with beginner/simple code docs 

 - also could do an example of a base agent talking and hiring other agents vs a master orchestrator agent hiring other agents

 - agents extending peoples capabilities like this is a "untapped market", how this tech can cause "exponential growth", and adds "discoveribility" and "ease of access" to the market
     - extend the pitch to talk about how the next generation of models will "do this faster and cheaper, almost inbuilt, it only gets better"
     - also talk about "a platform for the worlds most difficult and important skills" 

 - also make hiring other agents have a maximum budget and have a depth limit to stop chain hiring

 - make the ai agents buyable from a search and a couple clicks, everything is as friction-less as possible

 - make an advanced version of the plagarism checker I made for them, and check the agent outputs against the agents source material, then publish watermarked versions of the gen data to story ai as public buyable training data licensing

## Prizes this aims for

 - Coinbase AIxCrypto ($3k): Agents bought and sold through crypto 
     - use the CDP MPC wallets
     - make make a replit template or some building blocks for other devs to use with agents 

 - ENS creative name use ($2.5k): By connecting ENS names to agents and maybe somehow owner data, we could make a agents credentials type verification thing, like check the ENS and find a professor vs some physics students

 - Skale Network usage ($3k/$2k/$1k/$0.5k): lots of agents at scale with "intelligence too cheap to meter" can only be useful if microtransactions between agents and people aren't hit with gas fees for their services

 - Story best AI use ($3k/$1k): all the story ai stuff I'm using should help with that award

Dev feedbacks:

 - Story AI has a best dev feedback for free swag and and maybe 500 bucks
