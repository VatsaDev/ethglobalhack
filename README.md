# Æxtend: Extending yourself

Æxtend (pronounced like extend, the AE is just meant to make the E feel strechted out) is a way to take your life, your specialty, and spread it everywhere. 
Default models aren't so great, but there can be lots of them, and you're amazing at what you do, but there's only one of you.
Æxtend combines your skills with the avalibility of a language model, which makes it smarter than all other models avalible in the market at that skill

Usually Gemini 1.5 < GPT-4o
For us, Gemini 1.5+Æxtend > GPT-4o

There is also Yddgrasil mode, which is several Gemini 1.5+Æxtend skills put togther, this is >4o, weaker than o1(Actually CAN BEAT o1 50% of the time), but can reason with many more diverse skills and over much longer sizes (1M tokens), giving it some advantages over even the strongest models
